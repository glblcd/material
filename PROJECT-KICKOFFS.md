## Project kick off

Here are some things to consider while deciding on your final week project:

### Your product

* What are you going to make?

* What problem does this solve?

* Who are you making it for?

* What technologies / programming languages are you going to use?

### Your planning

* How are you going to divide up the work?

* How are you going to plan your time?

* How are you going to keep track of your progress?

* How are you going to support your team mates?

* What might you need to research?

* What other help might you need?
