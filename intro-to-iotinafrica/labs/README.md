# ![IoT in Africa: Labs](/assets/img/logo-small.png) IoT in Africa: Labs

Our teaching is supplemented by *lab work*. In fact - it's quite often the other way around -
you'll spend a lot more time coding than we will talking!

> *Note*
> This README file is written in `markdown`, a meta-language for documentation on the web.
> GitHub comes with a `markdown` *renderer*, which reads the source and converts it into
> HTML that you can view in a web browser. If your project includes a `README.md` file,
> GitHub will render it automatically.

All of our lab work currently exists as skeleton projects in our own GitHub project. To get
started with your first lab, follow the instructions here. We'll ask you to do most of the labs
in pairs, but you'll need to do at least this on your own.

## <a name="1"></a>Create a GitHub profile

The first thing we want you to do is create your own GitHub profile. If you already have one, you can skip
this step - go right ahead & fork the iotinafrica/intro-to-iotinafrica project in the [next section](#2)!

* Browse to github.com and hit 'create account'. Fill out the form, and you're done!
* You might want to upload a picture, too.
* Find some software projects hosted on github that you've used in the past and *star* them.

## <a name="2"></a>Make a fork of this introductory project.

* Hit the 'fork' button up at the top-right.
* This will create a copy of our project that you can work on. If, in the future, you make a change that
you think we should know about, you can send us that change and we'll choose if we like it.
* Read more about forking git projects *here*

## <a name="3"></a>Edit class list
* Add your name and github profile link to the file `classlist`. It'll have at least one there, and
depending on how quick you are to clone the project, maybe a couple more too :)
* Check the change into your local repo then push to your github fork using `git push`
* Go to the file on your github project page to make sure your changes have been pushed to github.
* Create a `pull request` to the original repo (iotinafrica/intro-to-iotinafrica) for me to accept

That's it! Your first taste of GitHub. We'll spend a lot more time talking about git and GitHub soon.
