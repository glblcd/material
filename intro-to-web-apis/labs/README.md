# ![Intro to Web APIs: Exploratory session](/assets/img/logo-small.png) Intro to Web APIs: Exploratory session

Welcome to the Web APIs explore session. For the rest of the day, we want you to work in small groups 
(maybe double up your pairs) to build an application that does something interesting using the programmable
web.

Don't rush - spend some time looking at the options available to you. You might need to sign up for a
free or trial account, that's cool.

Try to choose something that's personally interesting to your group, because that way you'll stay motivated.

Make sure you use your knowledge of git and python modules, so you can split up the project into tasks and all
work at once.

It'd be really great if your project had some kind of visualisation - the more real-time the better - so bear
that in mind.
