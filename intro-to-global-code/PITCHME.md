---
## Who are we?
* Software engineers
* Professionals
* Educators

Note:

this is a great opportunity to introduce yourselves & talk about your own backgrounds.

What made you want to become a programmer? What do you get from it? Why would you encourage someone else to have a go?

+++
## Who are we?
* We're from all over Europe & the US

---
## Who are you?
* Software engineers!
* Hand-picked

Note:

The point here is that everyone is a programmer, we don't do any gatekeeping here. If you're in the room, you're one of us. Here the lamplighters can talk about their experience at Global Code last year, and how things have changed for them in the last 12 months.

+++
## Who are you?
* Selection criteria wasn't about grades
* Who doesn't want to change the world?!

Note:

This is a good chance to talk about how we chose members of the class. It was entirely based on their applications. We asked four questions:

* What difference is technology making in your life right now?
* What difference does technology make to the lives of your family or the people around you?
* What will you be doing a month after the summer programme has finished?
* Read about the "moonshot philosophy". What's your moonshot for Ghana?

We're looking for people who are bold and excited about facing societal challenges with technology. We want to provide fuel for that fire & give you some of the skills you'll need.

---
## What are we here for?
* Learn Python, some electronics
* Internet of Things

Note:

We have to teach you some stuff first of all. So there's lots of labs, which you *must* do. In the second week we'll get to building cool stuff, and in the third and final week you'll design and build a project yourselves, in groups.

+++
## What are we here for?
* Learn to be PRO
* Gain the tools to improve the world

Note:

A lot of our students are excited to learn what a professional software engineer does. So let's talk about version control, CI, platforms, project management etc.

---
## Plan
* 3 weeks
* Raspberry Pi
* Advanced Python
* Electronics
* Internet of Things

+++
## Plan
All kinds of other cool stuff!
* We're *really* good at this
* who's used git? Render? Raspberry Pi ? Arduinos ?
* cool projects
* FUN!

+++
## Plan
* 9am - 4pm
* Lunch @ 12
* Casual dress
* Join slack & whatsapp
* Do the labs :)

Note:

We've discovered it's very useful to be overly strict about time. It's really the only thing that works. Start teaching at 9 and people will figure it out. And don't stay late becuase it overly disadvantages women who are more likely to have to get home. Aside from that, it's your room - feel free to shift furniture around, listen to music, show videos if you have the bandwidth. Have fun :)
