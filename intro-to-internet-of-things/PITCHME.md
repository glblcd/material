## Internet of Things
"The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide."
> Wikipedia

Note:

I hate wikipedia definitions but I guess you've got to start somewhere. 

Remember that one of our application questions was "What difference does technology make to the lives of your family or the people around you?". Really nice opportunity to rekindle that discussion and learn how people use the internet here, before kicking off the class about hardware and physical compute.

It's likely that by this time you've done the GPIO work, so our students should hopefully start to see how all this ties together!

## Internet of Things
"The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data."

Fitbit - a wearable IoT device

Note:
The FitBit is a "wearable" device which senses and records your heartrate and stepcount. When you get home it uploads this information to the internet where you can access it and share it with your friends. FitBit allows you to set goals and alerts you when you've met them by buzzing on your arm. There's a website and an app for your phone.

Nest - a home automation system

Note:
Nest is a home automation thermostat which monitors and regulates the temperature in your house. It saves you money and helps the environment by detecting when you've left the house and switching off energy-consuming devices. You set a desired temperature and it intelligently maintains a comfortable room for you.

Hue - smart lights with an app

Note:
Philips Hue is an intelligent light that's controllable through an app, or through Siri on your iPhone. You can set different moods for different times of the day - for example have the lights dimmed in the evening - or have pre-set choices for when you have a party or event.

  * "Recipes" for IoT
Note:
We'll browse to www.ifttt.com - to see how we can quickly and easily "tie up" internet events. Look here for some example recipes: https://ifttt.com/discover

Note:
Here you can also talk about some potential drawbacks for IoT. In my experience the class is more attuned to job losses through automation than they are to security concerns.
